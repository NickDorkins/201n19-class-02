  <h1>Nicholas Dorkins</h1>

  <p>As a software developer I want to always push myself to be learning something new. My current role as Director of Safety and Compliance has allowed me to develop experience in OSHA Compliance, DOT Regulations, EPA standards. My background prior to this is in fabrication, freight/inventory control, shipping/receiving, and order fulfillment for internal production and/or customer service. I am fanatical about process, keeping everybody on the team well-informed, supporting budgets and meeting or beating project schedules. I take advantage of training, education and advancement opportunities that allow me to expand my knowledge, problem-solving and leadership capabilities.</p>
