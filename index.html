  <p id="life">Let's start by saying that my adventure in this thing called life has been a roller coaster ride that I
    would not trade for anything.</p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p id="openParagraph">I was born in Denver, Colorado in 1990 where I spent the first 3 months in the Intensive Care
    Unit at Saint Josephs Hospital. In the first 15 days that I was alive I had 3 major surgeries, stoma reconstruction,
    open heart surgery(co-arch repair), and the removal of the lower 80% of my intestinal colon tract and died once
    during these operations. I was given a 10% chance of survival through the night after my heart surgery because at
    the time the surgery that was performed was simply theoretical, it had never been performed and had no data to
    reflect against. After surviving all of the surgeries, my parents were told that I wouldn't make it past 10 without
    a full heart transplant.</p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p id="sports">I grew up being a huge fan of the Quebec Nordiques hockey team, around my 5th birthday in 1995 they
    relocated to Colorado and are now the Colorado Avalance. In 1997 my family moved to Springfield, Ohio where found
    that I also enjoyed college football. I have been a die-hard Ohio State Buckeyes since I was 8. 2001 I moved back to
    Denver where I found my love of the Marine Corps through my enrollment in my high school's MCJROTC program. I spent
    2004-2008 anticipating the day that I could join the Marine Coprs and I was unfourtunately turned away even though I
    researched every loophole that would allow me to server. I recieved my GED in 2011 and have steadily traversed the
    job market starting in customer service, moving to physical labor and forklift operations, to landing a job as the
    Director of Safety and Compliance for a chemical manufacture in Lynnwood, WA.</p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p id="survival">The 2 thing that I have been the most blessed with in this life have been meeting and marrying my
    beautiful bride and recently celebrating my 30th birthday without any surgeries.</p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>

  <p id="careerParagraph">As a software developer I want to always push myself to be learning something new. My current
    role as Director of Safety and Compliance has allowed me to develop experience in OSHA Compliance, DOT Regulations,
    EPA standards. My background prior to this is in fabrication, freight/inventory control, shipping/receiving, and
    order fulfillment for internal production and/or customer service. I am fanatical about process, keeping everybody
    on the team well-informed, supporting budgets and meeting or beating project schedules. I take advantage of
    training, education and advancement opportunities that allow me to expand my knowledge, problem-solving and
    leadership capabilities.</p>
